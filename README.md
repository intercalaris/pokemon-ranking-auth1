Demo: https://pokemon-ranking-auth1.onrender.com/

A full-stack Pokémon collaborative ranking app using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Passport.js for user authentication. Users can log in, add and delete Pokémon to and from a leaderboard, and vote on them. The leaderboard pyramid updates based on user ratings.

Built with Node.js for backend logic, Express for routing, MongoDB for database management, and EJS for dynamic views. Method-Override enables PUT and DELETE operations in forms. The app uses MongoDB ObjectIDs to query and manipulate database records in CRUD operations.

To run locally, clone the repository, install dependencies with npm install, configure the database URL, and start the server with node server.js. Access at http://localhost:8080
